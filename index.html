                    <h1>Personal Data in Images</h1>
                    <p>In this task you are asked to inspect an image and look for any personal data in that picture. This judgement of whether an element is personal data or not should be made according to the definition given by the GDPR. For each personal element that you find, you are asked to draw a bounding box around it, such that the whole element is contained, and attach a label of what that element is.</p>
                    <p>Based on the elements you selected, you are asked with which elements you are able to identify a person (see the definition below on what is considered identifying elements), and whether the image as whole still contains personal data when these elements are left out (through blurring, obfuscation, etc.).</p>
                    <p>Lastly, you can fill in any remarks you have about the task, image, etc.</p>
                    <p>In total there are five images that have to be assessed, in the top-right corner you can see your progress, along with a button to revisit the instructions.</p>

                    <p>"The data subjects are identifiable if they can be directly or indirectly identified, especially by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or one of several special characteristics, which expresses the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, commercial, cultural or social identity of these natural persons. In practice, these also include all data which are or can be assigned to a person in any kind of way. For example, the telephone, credit card or personnel number of a person, account data, number plate, appearance, customer number or address are all personal data."</p>
